"""Command dispatch: the one place where decisions become effects.

The engine emits commands. This module is the *only* code that turns them into
calls on real capabilities. Keeping that translation in a single, small,
exhaustive `match` is what lets the boundary be checked mechanically -- if a
command has no arm here, dispatch fails loudly rather than silently doing
nothing.

Ticket 1 ships the seam and its wiring; the per-command bodies fill in alongside
their adapters.
